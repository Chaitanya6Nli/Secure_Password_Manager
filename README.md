## üí° How It Works

### Generate Password

You enter options like:

* Length
* Include lowercase, uppercase, digits, or special characters

The program creates a random password using your choices.

### Check Strength

Then, it checks if the password is weak, medium, or strong.

### Save Securely

Next, it encrypts the password using **Fernet** from the `cryptography` library.

After that, it saves it to a file named `saved_passwords.txt` with timestamp and label.

### View Passwords

Finally, you can view all saved passwords using a button in the GUI or a script in CLI.

## ‚ö†Ô∏è Security Note

This project uses **Fernet encryption** to protect your saved passwords.

Files like `secret.key` and `saved_passwords.txt` are excluded from version control using `.gitignore`.

> Do not share your `secret.key` with anyone. If you lose it, saved passwords cannot be decrypted.

## üíº Ideal For:

* Python beginners who want a real-world project
* Students looking to learn encryption and GUI
* Anyone who wants a simple password manager
