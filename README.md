# üîê Secure Password Manager (CLI + GUI)

This is a simple and secure Password Manager built with Python. It includes both a **Tkinter-based GUI (Graphical User Interface)** and a **CLI (Command Line Interface)** version.

## üìå Features

* ‚úÖ Generate strong, random passwords
* ‚úÖ Choose what characters to include (lowercase, uppercase, digits, special characters)
* ‚úÖ Real-time password strength feedback
* ‚úÖ Save passwords with labels (e.g., Gmail, Netflix)
* ‚úÖ Encode/Encrypt passwords for security
* ‚úÖ View saved passwords with automatic decryption
* ‚úÖ GUI built using Python's `tkinter` library
* ‚úÖ CLI version with command-line options using `argparse`

## üí° How It Works

### Tkinter GUI

The graphical interface is built using `tkinter`, Python‚Äôs standard GUI toolkit. It provides a clean interface for generating, encrypting, and viewing passwords.

### Generate Password

1. Choose the password length.
2. Select character types using checkboxes.
3. Hit the **Generate Password** button.
4. The password is displayed with its strength (Weak, Medium, or Strong).
5. The password is then **encrypted** and saved to a file.

### View Saved Passwords

1. Click the **View Saved Passwords** button in the GUI.
2. If the encryption key exists, the program decrypts and displays all saved passwords in a pop-up window.
3. If the key is missing or corrupted, an error message is shown.

```bash
Password_Manager/
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ password_manager_gui.py       # Tkinter-based GUI application
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ password_manager_cli.py       # CLI-based password generator
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ view_passwords_cli.py         # View decoded Base64 passwords (CLI)
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ decrypt_passwords_cli.py      # Decrypt encrypted passwords (CLI)
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ saved_passwords.txt           # File where encrypted passwords are saved
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ secret.key                    # File containing Fernet encryption key

## ‚ö†Ô∏è Security Note

This project uses **Fernet encryption** to protect your saved passwords.

Files like `secret.key` and `saved_passwords.txt` are excluded from version control using `.gitignore`.

> Do not share your `secret.key` with anyone. If you lose it, saved passwords cannot be decrypted.

## üß† Ideal For

- Python beginners learning `tkinter`
- Students building secure Python projects
- Learning encryption basics with `cryptography`
- Practicing Git and GitHub workflow with versioned features
